# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the project
1. This project is a simple react app that uses the React-ChatBot-kit npm package to create a chatbot.
2. The chatbot is a simple one that can be used to book an appointment.
3. The Project has a simple UI that can be used to interact with the user.
4. The Project also uses Redux to manage the state of the application.
5. The Project also uses the react-router-dom package to create a simple routing system.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, First you have to install the necessary dependencies by running:

### `npm install`

Then you can run the app in the development mode by running:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
